# Proof Obligations: Actual bounded FTL ordinary-limit reconciliation

Task id: `ONLINE-FTL-OBSTRUCTION-20261009`

Source card:
Scenario card:

| Node | Target | Dependencies | Local APIs/imports | Retrieval cards | Intended proof route | Regularity contracts | Mathlib status | Owner | Lean declaration | Gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ONLINE-FTL-OBSTRUCTION-20261009-ROOT` | root theorem or definition | conversion window | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | project-local | upper | TBD | `lake build && lake build Tests` | planned |

## Failure Classification

Use exactly one:

- source translation gap;
- local Lean lemma gap;
- theorem-card dependency;
- external cited result;
- semantic interface gap;
- missing regularity contract;
- likely false statement or counterexample;
- invalid route;
- stale dynamic leaf;
- connected blocker.

## Reviewer Notes

- Keep failed attempts in `proof-attempts/ONLINE-FTL-OBSTRUCTION-20261009/`.
- Do not promote simulator checks, prose sketches, or theorem cards to certified memory.
- If an LML theorem is used, cite the upstream declaration and record whether it is imported, ported, or only a theorem card.
- Do not frequently change proof strategy; record the mathematical reason before pivoting.
- Mark general leaf lemmas as Mathlib candidates when they should become reusable upstream infrastructure.


## Draft source contract

Four derived targets in docs/contracts/online-ftl-obstruction-v1; D1 first dependency-ready leaf. Binary dyadic stream must be produced, no supplied limit/regret oracle. Source correction proposed separately; whole Goal ACTIVE, no chapter/source closure.
